massive revision of coffee os underway. stay tuned!
08/23:
uhh so i forgot about coffee os and i think i lost the files. full software change coming soon before my python mishap where i forgot EVERYTHING. 
dont expect much but for like the 2 people that see this please follow me throughout the months and years.
also expect ms dos looking type of stuff. i am going to take code from others with their permission so i can do stuff like files and users.


04/23:
(update log on how i am going, not too well)
i have lost the MS-DOS beta-ish type. we will have to wait until i can get the code running again. please note that i took an hour to make the code, before an update corrupted it.
the python beta is VERY unstable and buggy. i used chatgpt because i am ass and i forgot python ):


timeline:
2024- hopeful rewrite successful and has 75% of features. python rewrite may take to 2025.
2026 i hope i can learn C


yes guys i have been working on an update until i had to reset my computer. setting me back 3 months.
