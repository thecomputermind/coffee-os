BETA IS HERE, NOW IN A PREVIEW VERSION, WHERE I MAKE THE OS OVERCLUTTERED WITH PROPAGANDA!
but seriously, its gonna be huge!
just stay tuned in.

i plan on:
a command line (not sure, its not useful now)
more apps (yes.)
trying to rework the entire file explorer for coffee os (command line can make files if i add it, or files.bat will be able to)
a text editor app! (duh)
time on the menu, like a very old os i made in like, 2020.
weird files or files that have no extension (that can be opened with apps)
postponing users!
trying to get setup to work....
maybe a demo, possibly..
maybe a dos version 
most likely some stuff i dont even know how to code
