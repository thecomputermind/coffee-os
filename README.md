massive revision of coffee os underway. stay tuned!

(update log on how i am going, not too well)
i have lost the MS-DOS beta-ish type. we will have to wait until i can get the code running again. please note that i took an hour to make the code, before an update corrupted it.
the python beta is VERY unstable and buggy. i used chatgpt because i am ass and i forgot python ):
